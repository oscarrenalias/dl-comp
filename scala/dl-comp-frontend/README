How to get started
-------------------
1) Install the Scala plugin for Eclipse. Use the following URL as the source for the software in Eclipse
via (Help->Install new software...): http://www.scala-lang.org/node/94

2) Install the Egit plugin for Eclipse. Use this URL for the software download: http://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates

3) Import the project data from the git repository:

3.1) In eclipse, go to File->Import...
3.2) Select "Git Repository" under Git
3.3) Enter the following data in the URI field: git+ssh://git@github.com/phunkphorce/dl-comp.git. Let
the git importer fill in the rest of values
3.4) Select the master branch
3.5) Select where to import the project and click Finish

Once completed, you should have the "dl-comp-frontend" project installed in your Eclipse.

Adding the Scala JAR files
--------------------------
If not defined yet, the Maven repository folder needs to be defined.

Right click where it says "Referenced Libraries" and then select Build Path->Configure Build Path...
Make sure that the variable M2_REPO is defined and pointing to your Maven repository, with a value
like /Users/oscar/.m2/repository (in Unix-like systems), or c:\Users\oscar.renalias\.m2\repository (in Windows)

How to commit files
-------------------
1) make your changes to the file. If it's a new file:
1.1) Make sure you add it to the repository by right clicking on it, then select
Team->Add to Version Control
2) Commit your changes: "Team->Commit..." Write a relevant comment
3) Once done, right click on the project name and then select Team->Push To... For some reason it is not possible
to just select the default folder that we configured so we need to write the server and account settings to get it to push
Use the following settings:

URI: git+ssh://git@github.com/phunkphorce/dl-comp.git
Host: github.com
Repository path: /phunkphorce/dl-comp.git
Protocol: git+ssh
User: git
Password: you can type it now or you will be asked later

In the next screen, click "Add all branches spec" and click Finish. If everything went well
you should see a message in green background with the push id.

How to run the application
--------------------------
Edit file config/webshop.conf and change the value of variable "mode" to "localhost" if the REST backend
is running locally, or "amazon" if you are testing with the REST backend running in the NetWeaver server currently
located in AWS (note: that server is currently not available)

mode = "localhost"

Make sure that you start the REST server before starting the Scala frontend.

From the application folder, run the following maven task:

mvn jetty:run

Alternatively, you can create an external tool configuration to execute jetty:run automatically
from within the IDE
