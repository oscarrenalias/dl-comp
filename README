In order to run the frontend, the backend must also be running

Running the backend
--------------------
After you have cloned the repository from github, go to folder java/webshop-backend/ and type:

	mvn exec:java

If this is the first time that the server is run, Maven will download the necessary dependencies, so it may take a while.

You can check that the backend is running by pointing your browser to http://localhost:9998/item/2. You should get a nice Json response.

Running the frontend
--------------------
Edit file scala/dl-comp-frotend/config/webshop.conf in the webshop frontend folder and change the value of variable "mode" to "localhost" if the REST backend
is running locally, or "amazon" if you are testing with the REST backend running in the NetWeaver server currently
located in AWS (note: that server is currently not available)

mode = "localhost"

Make sure that you start the REST server before starting the Scala frontend.

In order to run the frontend Scala application, go to folder scala/dl-comp-frotend/ and type:

		mvn jetty:run

Again, if this is the first time that the server is run Maven will download all the necessary dependecies.

The Scala application runs in http://localhost:8080/
